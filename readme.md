# Express Auth Starter

Get started quickly with an express project that has a local authentication system built in.

It uses the ejs view engine, and sequelize as an ORM. The dev data connection is a sqlite3 database but because sequelize is a flexible ORM it should be able to map to any databse that sequelize supports.
